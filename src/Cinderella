In the Grimm's version of "Cinderella," a young girl named Aschenputtel (Cinderella) is mistreated by her cruel stepmother and stepsisters
forced to live as a servant and sleep by the fireplace.
She gains assistance from a magical tree that grows from her mother's grave, which grants her wishes.
Cinderella attends a royal festival, captivating the prince with her beauty, and leaves behind a slipper.
The prince searches for the slipper's owner, and after a series of trials with her stepsisters, Cinderella is revealed as the true owner.
In the end, the prince marries Cinderella, and the stepsisters, who had mutilated their feet to try to fit the slipper, have their eyes pecked out by birds.
